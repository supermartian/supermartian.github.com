title: End of August 

Summer is about to end, or just say, it has already past.

Just like other summers before, I planned a lot a the beginning, but by the end of summer, only a few have been achieved. Anyway at least something has been achieved during this summer, better than nothing. I, the one who has been suffering from procrastination for decades, almost finished a [NES emulator](https://github.com/supermartian/qmnes), by the end of August, which is far beyond my expectation.

Maybe it's because I've been living a cozy life since the first day of my graduate study, I decided to have some heavy courses in this semester. Two of them are about reading literatures and giving reviews about them. Those papers really make me like getting a PhD degree.

Speaking about PhD, I've made a 'promise' to myself once, which is having the girl I like to be my girlfriend by the end of spring, and if I fail it, go for a PhD and stop thinking this shit again. This probably is the most ridiculous promise I've ever made. Well, I'm looking forward to see if I can keep this promise.

Let's start this new September.
